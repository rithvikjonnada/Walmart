# WalmartSalesAnalysis
I have found a walmart sales data in kaggle to work on. Used SQL to alter table and pull valuable insights. Visualized the data in PowerBI, creating an interactive dashboard for a deeper and clearer picture to analyze several metrics.
The second dataset is the one which was altered in SQL for better analysis, used it in creating dashboard in PowerBI.
